# Exercise: Nodes-4

# The ticker process in this chapter is a central server that sends 
# events to registered clients. Reimplement this as a ring of clients. 

# A client sends a tick to the next client in the ring. After 2 seconds, 
# that next client sends a tick to its next client. When thinking about 
# how to add clients to the ring, remember to deal with the case where 
# a clientâ€™s receive loop times out just as youâ€™re adding a new process. 

# What does this say about who has to be responsible for updating the 
# links?
