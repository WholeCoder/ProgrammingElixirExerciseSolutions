# Exercise: WorkingWithMultipleProcesses-7

# Change the ^pid in pmap to _pid. This means that the receive block 
# will take responses in the order the processes send them. Now run 
# the code again. Do you see any difference in the output? If youâ€™re 
# like me, you donâ€™t, but the program clearly contains a bug. Are you
# scared by this? Can you find a way to reveal the problem 
# (perhaps by passing in a different function, or by sleeping, 
# or increasing the number of processes)? Change it back
# to ^pid and make sure the order is now correct.
